# Monte_Carlo

This repository contains code written for simulating a 2D Ising Model. The code is stored in a jupyter notebook called MC.ipynb. Umbrella sampling is performed using a harmonic potential, and the Ising model is sampled at a range of temperatures about its critical temperature. The Metropolis Algorithm is utilized. 

Additionally, a preliminary report submitted for the class, CHEM 444, at Northwestern University.
